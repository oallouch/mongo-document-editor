# mongo-document-editor
mongodb document editor in JavaFX

Adds a JavaFX TreeTable at the collection viewer and a component to build queries that can output them as php or Java source code.

In brief, it's an attempt to make umongo a bit sexier, but the umongo owner, Antoine Girbal didn't seem interested, so...to the bin !
